HOW TO SET UP:
run init_db.py to create the database, making sure that the database does not already exist

Note to Spencer and Heshi: I set it up so that you should just be able to do the parsing in main() of main.py,
but you guys can set it up however you want. all the db retrieval functions are in main.py.
